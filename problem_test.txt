Data Engineer Test

Scenario

At XYZ we use the open source event analytics platform Snowplow. It enables us to collect very granular data about our customers from various sources as a unified customer view. We use this data to analyse customers' behaviour and to train our machine learning algorithms for personalisation and to predict the right actions to engage customers as much as possible.
For daily reporting purposes we are interested in the following metrics:
number of active users (users who visited our website on day X and day X-1)
number of inactive users (users who didn't visit our website on day X and neither on day X-1)
number of churned users (users who visited our website on day X-1, but didn't visit on day X)
number of reactivated users (users who visited our website on day X, but didn't visit on day X-1)
[optional] number of sessions (we define session as a set of events per user with gaps no more than 30 minutes)

Data

The data to be used for this test is available at https://s3-eu-west-1-gousto-test/events.gz. It contains about 1.5 million events and for this test we included page-views only. Each event (record) has the following attributes: event_id, timestamp, user_fingerprint, domain_userid, network_userid, page.

Requirements

Create ETL process(es) to prepare metrics listed in scenario.
Preferred programming language is Python, but please feel free to use any other programming language if you don't feel comfortable with Python.
As we store events in Redshift, we prefer you to use SQL to aggregate data, but feel free to use any other technology, e.g. Hadoop, Pig, Spark etc.
Suppose that ETL process(es) need(s) to be run on a daily basis, but feel free to run it on a more frequent basis if you prefer.
Suggest at what time ETL process(es) should be run.

Nice-to-haves

A way to schedule ETL process(es) - feel free to use any tool or framework.
ETL process(es) should be deployable, ideally in AWS environment.
We'd like to be notified if ETL process(es) failed for some reason.

Not expected
Not expecting any reports / dashboards.

Tips

Are ETL processes configurable and reusable?
What happens if ETL process(es) fail(s) for some reason? Can it be re-run and will still get correct metrics?

Deliverable
Please send back a zip file containing all of the assets required for us to run and test the ETL process.
Please also include a README explaining your solution along with any relevant instructions to get the ETL process set up.
